        <section>
            <h2>Underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5)</h2>
            <p><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Increased risk of malnutrition, osteoporosis, anemia, and other health
                issues related to nutrient deficiencies. It can also indicate underlying health conditions or eating
                disorders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9)</h2>
            <p><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Generally associated with the lowest risk of weight-related health
                problems. However, it's important to remember that BMI doesn't measure body fat directly, so it's
                possible to have a healthy BMI and still have a high body fat percentage.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Overweight (BMI 25–29.9)</h2>
            <p><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and
                certain cancers. Being overweight can also lead to metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of heart
                disease and diabetes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Obesity (BMI ≥ 30)</h2>
            <p><strong>Class 1 (BMI 30–34.9)</strong><br>
                <strong>Health Risks:</strong> Increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
                certain cancers, and sleep apnea.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Class 2 (BMI 35–39.9)</strong><br>
                <strong>Health Risks:</strong> Higher risk of the same conditions as Class 1, but more severe. Increased
                likelihood of developing serious health complications.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Class 3 (BMI ≥ 40)</strong><br>
                <strong>Health Risks:</strong> Highest risk of obesity-related health conditions, including severe
                cardiovascular disease, severe sleep apnea, joint problems, and a significantly increased risk of
                mortality.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitations of BMI:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doesn't measure body fat directly:</strong> BMI is a simple calculation based on height and
                    weight, and it doesn't differentiate between muscle and fat mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Doesn't account for distribution of fat:</strong> Where you carry your weight (e.g., around
                    your waist vs. hips) can also affect health risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Variability with age, sex, and ethnicity:</strong> BMI may not be equally predictive of
                    health risk across different populations and ages. For instance, older adults might have more body
                    fat at the same BMI compared to younger adults.</li>
                <li><strong>Athletes and muscular individuals:</strong> They may have a higher BMI due to increased
                    muscle mass, not increased body fat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite these limitations, BMI is a useful screening tool when used alongside other assessments and
                measurements to evaluate an individual's overall health.</p>
